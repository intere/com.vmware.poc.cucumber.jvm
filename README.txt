Before you can do anything with this project, pay special attention to the lib directory.  
There is an install.sh script you'll need to run to install the maven dependencies for you.

Next - you'll want to configure the src/test/resources/com/vmware/poc/cucumber/jvm/poc-config.xml 
file to ssh to the appropriate host with the appropriate user and reference the appropriate TOMCAT_HOME directory.
